Fuelino SW 1.0 Beta5 for Fuelino Proto3 (28 February 2017)

Fuelino is an "open source" data-logger and electronic fuel injection controller for motorcycles/vehicles equipped with engines having up to 2 cylinders (2 injectors). In the most simple configuration, it acquires signals from the original ECU, such as injector command, throttle position sensor, lambda sensor signals, and is capable of modifying, in real-time, the injector command. This becomes necessary, for example, after upgrading some engine parts, such as installing a bore up kit, a new camshaft, air filter, or racing exhaust.

By connecting and additional Micro SD card module (example: Catalex Micro SD) through SPI, it is possible to log data.

It is also possible to expand the logging capabilities by adding an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), such as the MPU-6050, which acquires acceleration and gyroscope information; or also adding a GPS module, such as the Ublox Neo 6M, to acquire the instant position, in terms of latitude and longitude, UTC date and time, and speed (km/h).

The software has been tested on Fuelino Proto3, on my motorcycle, a Honda CBR125R equipped with Athena 166cc bore up kit, Akrapovic racing exhaust, and conical air filter. The higher engine displacement, together with other modifications, required me to calibrate a fuel injection time increment of about 25%.
